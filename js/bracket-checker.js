* This is the code for my next ssbm.tech pet project: a tool to help us TO weeklies
*
* Basically I need it to take two challonge brackets as input and it outputs whether or not
* any two players played last week in r1 or projected r2 or projected r1 losers.
*
* We do this by hand every weekly, so this should save tons of time!
